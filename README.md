# Movie_recommendation_system  

## Project Overview  
This is a **Content-Based Movie Recommendation System** that suggests movies similar to a given movie.  
The system analyzes **movie descriptions and genres** to find the most relevant recommendations.  

## Content-Based Filtering  
This system uses **Content-Based Filtering**, which recommends movies based on their features (e.g., plot, genre, director, cast).  
- Uses **TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency)** to convert movie descriptions into numerical representations.  
- Computes **Cosine Similarity** to find movies with similar content.  

## Features  
✅ Content-Based Recommendation using TF-IDF & Cosine Similarity  
✅ Suggests movies based on **textual features** (genre, description, keywords)  
✅ No user interaction data needed (unlike collaborative filtering)  
✅ Built using **Python & Scikit-Learn**  

## Technologies Used  
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-Learn, NLTK, Matplotlib  
- **Machine Learning Techniques**: TF-IDF Vectorization, Cosine Similarity  
- **Development Environment**: Jupyter Notebook
